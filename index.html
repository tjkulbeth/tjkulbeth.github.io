					<p>Trevor is amazing at going the "extra yard" to make our software projects utilize the more advanced features just recently taught to us. 
						While many Developers would simply get the basics done, Trevor will dig deep into the lectures and documentation to find the "wrapper" or the "function" that we can re-use, to make our code much more efficient. 
						Trevor is also very generous and open with his work and is truly a great resource to have on a development team. I absolutely recommend Trevor to help make a team more successful in their Data Visualization needs!</p>

					<p>I've known Trevor for the last seven months but I felt I like knowing him forever. 
						We've worked on the same team on several projects and he out performed everyone by going for the extra miles. 
						He is not afraid of picking up a task that he has no clue of where to begin and yet he came out the other end glorious! He mastered Tableau in record time, this alone shows his excellent ability of adapting new skills. Whoever have him as his teammate will appreciate his enthusiasm, dedication, and openness.</p>

					<p>The Music industry has always been changing. Each 10-20 years we see a huge shift of medium of delivery revolutionized with newer and better technologies. These mini-revolutions affected not only musicians and listeners, they also changed our society in fundamental economic and cultural way.
					My Team and I looked into one specific aspect of this paradigm shift phenomenon – Spotify. A tiny Swedish company run by a 20-some year-old Daniel Ek overtook the industry by storm. In less than 10 years, they become the No.1 music provider of all media sources.
					We looked into the business data as well as its API to understand its various functions. This website is the showcase of several visualization techniques we deployed to demonstrate Spotify’s data.</p>
